## **Project: Security Automate Hub**

---

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the **Security Automate Hub**. This project aims to create a community-driven, open-source repository of cybersecurity automation scripts. It will serve as a central repo where beginners and experts alike can contribute, find, and use scripts for common tasks like reconnaissance, scanning, and utility functions.

### **1.2 Project Scope**

The project's primary goal is to build a structured collection of scripts.

**In-Scope:**

* A command-line interface (CLI) to browse and execute scripts.  
* A well-defined directory structure for script categories.  
* A collection of scripts for:  
  * Reconnaissance (e.g., subdomain enumeration, port scanning).  
  * Vulnerability Scanning (e.g., checking for specific CVEs, header analysis).  
  * Utilities (e.g., encoding/decoding, hash cracking).  
* Comprehensive contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md) to support Hacktoberfest.  
* Issue templates for requesting new scripts or reporting bugs.

## **2\. Overall Description**

### **2.1 Product Perspective**

Security Automate Hub is a new, standalone, community-driven tool. It will be hosted on GitHub and licensed under the MIT License to encourage maximum contribution and usage. The project's success is directly dependent on its modularity and the clarity of its contribution guidelines, making it ideal for an event like Hacktoberfest.

### **2.2 Product Functions**

* **Discover:** Users can list all available script modules by category.  
* **Execute:** Users can run any script module directly from the central CLI.  
* **Contribute:** Developers can easily add new script modules by following a simple template and placing them in the correct directory.

### **2.3 User Characteristics**

* **End-User:** Assumed to have a basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts and be comfortable working in a terminal.  
* **Contributor:** Can range from a first-time open-source contributor to an experienced security professional. The project *must* cater to beginners with clear documentation and "good first issue" labels.

### **2.4 Constraints**

1. **Hacktoberfest-Ready:** The project *must* be structured to be easily understandable and modular. A new contributor should be able to add a new script in a single PR.  
2. **Primary Language:** The core CLI wrapper will be written in **Python 3.9+**.  
3. **Script Languages:** Contributions will be accepted in **Python (.py)** and **Bash (.sh)**. Python is preferred for cross-platform compatibility.  
4. **Ethical Use:** All contributions must be for educational, defensive, or authorized offensive (pentes-ting) purposes. A strong disclaimer will be included.  
5. **Dependencies:** The core CLI will have minimal dependencies. Individual script modules must list their dependencies, which the user will install separately.

### **2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies**

* Users have git and python3 installed.  
* Users understand how to install Python packages (e.g., via pip).  
* Contributors will follow the CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md.

## **3\. Specific Requirements**

### **3.1 Functional Requirements**

#### **FR-1: Core CLI Framework**

The main.py script will be the primary entry point.

* **FR-1.1:** The CLI MUST provide a help menu when run with \-h or \--help.  
* **FR-1.2:** The CLI MUST provide a command to list all available script modules, grouped by category (e.g., python main.py \--list-tools).  
  * *Output Example:*  
    Reconnaissance:  
      \- nmap\_scan  
      \- subdomain\_enum  
    Scanning:  
      \- http\_header\_check

* **FR-1.3:** The CLI MUST provide a command to run a specific script module (e.g., python main.py \--run nmap\_scan \--target 1.1.1.1).  
* **FR-1.4:** The CLI MUST pass all subsequent arguments directly to the target script module (e.g., \--target 1.1.1.1 is passed to nmap\_scan.py).  
* **FR-1.5:** The CLI MUST provide a command to show detailed help/info for a *specific* script (e.g., python main.py \--info nmap\_scan). This will print the docstring/header from the script file.

#### **FR-2: Script Module Contribution**

This defines the requirements for each new script added to the scripts/ directory.

* **FR-2.1:** Each script MUST be placed in a logical category sub-directory (e.g., scripts/reconnaissance/).  
* **FR-2.2:** Each script MUST be executable on its own *as well as* through the CLI.  
* **FR-2.3 (Script Header):** Every script file MUST begin with a standardized comment block (docstring for Python) that defines:  
  * Author (GitHub username)  
  * Script Purpose  
  * Usage (standalone)  
  * Dependencies (any non-standard libraries)  
* **FR-2.4:** Scripts MUST accept targets (IPs, domains, files) as command-line arguments. Hardcoding targets is forbidden.  
* **FR-2.5:** Scripts SHOULD print their output to stdout in a clean, readable format.  
* **FR-2.6:** A contributor adding a new script MUST also update any relevant documentation if needed (though the CLI should ideally auto-discover scripts).

#### **FR-3: Documentation (Hacktoberfest Critical)**

* **FR-3.1 (README.md):** The main README.md must clearly state the project's purpose, installation steps, and basic usage of the CLI. It must prominently feature a link to CONTRIBUTING.md and a "Hacktoberfest" badge.  
* **FR-3.2 (CONTRIBUTING.md):** This file is the most important for Hacktoberfest. It must detail:  
  * How to find an issue (especially good-first-issue).  
  * How to request a new script idea.  
  * The fork-branch-PR workflow.  
  * The exact "Definition of Done" for a new script (header, argument parsing, placement in a folder).  
  * Code style guidelines (e.g., "Must pass Flake8 linter").  
* **FR-3.3 (Issue Templates):** The .github/ folder must contain:  
  * A template for **Bug Reports**.  
  * A template for **New Script Requests**, which will be the primary source of good-first-issue tasks.

### **3.2 Interface Requirements**

* **3.2.1 Command Line Interface (CLI):** This is the sole user interface.  
  * **Command:** python main.py \--list-tools  
    * **Description:** Lists all available scripts.  
  * **Command:** python main.py \--run \<script\_name\> \[script\_options\]  
    * **Description:** Executes the specified script. Example: python main.py \--run subdomain\_enum \--domain example.com  
  * **Command:** python main.py \--info \<script\_name\>  
    * **Description:** Prints the help/header from the specified script.
