[![Hacktoberfest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hacktoberfest-Ready-FF4500)](#)

Security Automate Hub is a community-driven, open-source repository of cybersecurity automation scripts.  
Itâ€™s designed to help security enthusiasts, students, and professionals quickly discover, run, and contribute tools for common tasks.

---

## âœ¨ Purpose
The project provides a central hub for automation scripts in areas like:
- **Reconnaissance** (e.g., subdomain enumeration, port scanning)  
- **Vulnerability Scanning** (e.g., CVE checks, HTTP header analysis)  
- **Utilities** (e.g., encoding/decoding, hash operations)  

By offering a clear structure and contribution process, the hub makes it easy for both beginners and experts to share tools, especially during events like Hacktoberfest.
